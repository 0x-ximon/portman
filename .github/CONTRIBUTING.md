# Contributing to Portman

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Portman is a personal project I'm building from scratch to learn more about trading systems, market data, and terminal interfaces. While this is primarily a learning resource for me, I welcome pull requests, bug reports, and feature suggestions from anyone interested in the project.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please use the **Bug Report** template in the Issues tab. Provide as much detail as possible to help me reproduce the error.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Have an idea for a new feature? I'd love to hear it! Please submit a **Feature Request** via the Issues tab.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests... again, please add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes... again, please make the tests pass.
4. Issue that pull request and Imma take a look at that bad boy.

## Why Contribute?

Since this is a learning project, I am especially interested in:

- **Code Reviews:** If you see a way I can make the architecture cleaner or more efficient, let me know.
- **Refactoring:** Improvements to readability and performance are always welcome.
